<h2 id="beginning">In the Beginning</h2>
<p>Rent A Pet began with a family that loved dogs. George Smith and his wife Carol owned two Irish Setters. These dogs were pets to the Smith family children and extended family members.</p>

<p>One day as George was walking his dogs in the park, he noticed how they attracted the attention of passing women. A young woman remarked that she would love to have a big dog like that to walk, but she had a small apartment and could not keep a large dog.</p>

<p>This encounter inspired an idea. What if there were others who wanted companionship from pets without the responsibility of ownership? George shared his idea with Carol, and they began exploring the possibility of starting a pet rental business.</p>
