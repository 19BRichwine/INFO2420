  <div class="section">
    <p><span class="label">What was your first impression of this site?:</span> This website seems to be well-made at first glance. The colors and links are very cohesive and user friendly.</p>

    <p><span class="label">How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?):</span> Most of the links are on the left side, to navigate to different places like products and recipes. There is a search function and more informational links on the top right. The main menu is in the top left as well, though.</p>

    <p><span class="label">Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why?:</span> It is easy to navigate, if I want to shop it is pretty obvious where to go. If i need recipes (using their ingredients) there is a place for that. If I need to find my local store, it's easy to change.</p>

    <p><span class="label">Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why?:</span> There is a lot, and I mean a lot, of things going on in this main page. Lots of pop-ups immediately for mailing list signups, cookies, details, and other announcements. It can be a little overwhelming.</p>

    <p><span class="label">How long did it take for the home page to load? Was the load time reasonable?:</span> It loaded very quickly and when navigating around the load-times are also very quick and easy.</p>

    <p><span class="label">Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used, did it enhance or detract from the site?:</span> The text color matches their theme very well, and the size seems normal and easier to read than expected. There is a lot of background color, but it enhances more than anything since it doesn't clash.</p>

    <p><span class="label">Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool? Was the navigation well done?:</span> Very easy to navigate if you're familiar with the layout of modern websites. If you're unaware of the 3 line menu button, it wouldn't be very easy to get around.</p>

    <p><span class="label">Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages?:</span> The color scheme was very on brand for their company, and it allows for confidence that you are on the right sight even as you navigate.</p>
	
	<p><span class="label">How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)?:</span> It resizes well, and quickly. Making it take half of the screen doesn't seem to make the website harder to use.</p>
	
    <p><span class="label">What does this site offer that was unusual or very well done?:</span> This site offers a simple navigation pane that has pictures that can draw your eyes to the places you need. If you need food, there's a picture of a banana among other pictures that have to do with the different categories.</p>
